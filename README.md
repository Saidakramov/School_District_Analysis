# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis.
  This analysis aimed to determine the effect of corrupted data on the whole DataFrame. I was informed that Maria and her supervisor detected academic dishonesty regarding Thomas High School's 9th-grade math and reading scores. Therefore, I was tasked to eliminate the corrupted elements in the data and report their effects on the results. 

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
-How is the district summary affected?
  - Original data district_summary_df
